## ***⚒️ How it works?***
### **Initially, a pipeline model from spacy is used to analyze the main text in portuguese. Then, we count the frequency of the words, putting it in a dictionary, and use that structured information in order to give a score to the sentences. Finally, having the sentences been verified and marked, we choose the most significant parts with the objective of forming the summarized text.**
